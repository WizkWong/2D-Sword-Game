# 2D-Sword-Game
A game I created is for fun.

I started when I finished learned the basic of python and programming fundamental, took me a month to create it, and the code is probably bad becuase that time I just started coding. The purpose is learning how to code and I want to create a game.

Here is a playthrough of the game I created
